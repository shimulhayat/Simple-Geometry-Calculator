Title: Simple Geometry Calculator
Problem Overview: 

You are tasked with building a console application that calculates both the perimeter and the area of a rectangle based on user input for its length and width. The core requirements: separating user input, core calculation logic, and result display into isolated methods within a single Java class.

Formulas:

AREA = LENGTH * WIDTH

PERIMETER = 2 * (LENGTH + WIDTH)

Tasks:

1. User Input: The user should not be allowed to enter negative numbers for length or width. If the user enters a negative number, the program should warn the user and ask them to re-enter the value.

2. Core calculation: Use a single method to calculate and return Area or Perimeter.

3. Display Output: Print the output in a formatted manner.
